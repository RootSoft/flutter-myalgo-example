/// MyAlgo is an Algorand Wallet allowing you to freely interact with the
/// Algorand blockchain.
///
/// MyAlgo provides the simplest and most secure way to send and receive Algos
/// and tokens, organize and track all your Algorand wallets, manage your
/// assets and much more.
///
/// MyAlgo Connect allows WebApp users to review and sign Algorand transactions
/// using accounts secured within their MyAlgo Wallet.
/// This enables Algorand applications to use MyAlgo Wallet to interact with
/// the Algorand blockchain and users to access the applications in a private
/// and secure manner.
///
/// The integration with MyAlgo Wallet allows users secure access to
/// Algorand DApps. Users only need to share their public addresses with the
/// WebApp and this in turn allows them to review and sign all types of
/// transactions without exposing their private keys.
///
/// The main novelty of MyAlgo Connect lies in the fact that all the process is
/// managed in the userâ€™s browser without the need for any backend service nor
/// downloads, extensions or browser plugins.
